# 100 Days of Swift
In this repo my implementation for the milestone projects of the [100 Days of Swift challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) can be found. These projects are completely built on my own though some projects include bits which were built in the tutorials Paul Hudson provides. 
If you have any suggestions or questions feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/niiklaas).


## About the challenge
The [challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) was started by Paul Hudson and is aimed at beginners. He provides materials for 100 days - some days are in a follow-along style, others provide programming challenges and quizzes and there are days where you have to build apps completely on your own called 'milestone projects'.
